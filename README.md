# British Shorthair Kitten Calculator

British shorthair cats are the most popular breed of cat in the UK. There is a large body of hobby breeders who enjoy raising kittens. However, feline genetics is a complicated area, and because the British Shorthair is available in a broad range of colours and patterns, it can be very difficult for breeders to predict what colour of kittens they will get from their cats. 

This kitten calculator is designed for hobby breeders, who have a basic knowledge of cat colours and feline genetics. It assumes, therefore, that its users will already know the basic terminology for feline colours: blue is grey, chocolate is brown, cinnamon is a warm brown, and so on. In order to make the application as accessible as possible, I have also opted to have images of each of the different variations of cats that is possible from the genes that have been used. This means that even where a user is not aware that blue means grey, there will be a visual representation of each colour and pattern. I used a recommended freelancer on Fiver to create these for the project, in the colours and patterns that I determined and provided photographs for. I am the owner of the copyright of these images since they were paid for with full commercial rights for use. 

The kitten calculator will be placed on an existing website. It will keep people returning to the site, thereby helping to increase web traffic. The website in question is a member of the Amazon Affiliate Marketing scheme, so an increase in web traffic may lead to an increase in site income through that scheme. It will also assist with establishing the website as a trusted source of expert information. 

## Users
Users will be British Shorthair breeders. Some will be new to breeding, or just considering breeding, and therefore not have any knowledge beyond the most basic terminology. Others will be more experienced, understand all the terminology and be able to calculate the colour of kittens themselves, but want a quicker or easier way of achieving it. 

This website presents an interesting exercise in user experience. For a very experienced breeder who understands feline genetics at a high level, there is a risk that images and explanations will simply crowd the page, reducing user experience. For a total novice who knows nothing about feline genetics, the more information the site provides, the better the user experience will be. 

The key in optimising user experience, therefore, is to try to gauge what level of genetic knowledge the majority of users will have, and aim to optimise user experience for that level of knowledge. Since this question was so vital to creating optimal user experience, I conducted a small survey of 20 breeders and found that only 5% had extensive knowledge of feline genetics. The vast majority understood basic terminology of coat colour (e.g. blue means grey), and understood the dominance of basic colours in practice, but did not fully understand the theory of recessive and dominant genes. 

A small number of breeders (10%), did not understand basic terminology or the hierarchy of colour dominance. 

I therefore chose to optimise user experience for those with a basic understanding of genetics in practice, whilst including images for the total novices, since this should provide optimal customer experience for the greatest number of users. This approach should allow the primary objective of increasing web traffic to be met. 

It may be that this site is not well suited to experienced breeders with expert knowledge of feline genetics. In future, I may create a second, ‘advanced’ version of this calculator that is aimed at experts and has a far more simple, ‘to the point’ user experience that simply allows a quick calculation to be performed without the fuss of explanations and images. 

## User Stories 
As a British Shorthair hobby breeder, I want to:
- Enter the genetic traits for two parents
- Calculate what colour kittens I can expect from the two entered parents
- Consider what pairings would produce kittens of the colour I want, so that I can make an informed decision
- Improve my understanding of feline genetics 
- Navigate the application easily 

## UX

### Colour Scheme
Whilst the existing website is not targeted solely at cat breeders, it is a feline-focused website, so I looked at the statistics for the past 12 months on google analytics to get information about the demographics of its typical user. The website is predominantly used by female users, but still has a significant number of male users (66.6% vs 33.4% male users). It was therefore important to choose a colour scheme that was not overly-directed at any particular gender stereotype. 

The most common age of users is 25-34, followed by 18-34 and 35-44. It is notable that google analytics was only able to collect age data for just under 25% of the total sessions, so this data may not be accurate across all of the sessions. Nevertheless, this still comprised around 25,000 sessions where age was recorded, making it a reasonably good sized data set. It shows a clear trend for typical age range within the sample that we have available. 

Millennials are generally considered to be between the ages of 26-40 (Gallup) whilst Gen Z-ers are considered to be age 10-25 (Gallup). These two generational groups therefore represent the bulk of the total user demographic for this client, comprising around 70% of the total session count. 

This gave a clear steer for the user experience and branding for the application. A major part of the design was choosing the visual representations of the cat colours. I considered using photographs but it would have been almost impossible to find photographs that had enough continuity of style to provide a consistent user experience, which was vital for the flow of the application. After some research, I decided on using illustrations in a cute, slightly manga-inspired style. This design decision then helped to inform the colour palette choice. Modern, on-trend colours were used to reflect current design trends: I opted for a slightly retro, 90’s inspired, cartoon-esque feel.

It was also important that the colours used complimented the cat images, and did not fight with or overpower them so that the cat images remain the central focus of the site. 

Ease of use was also a major consideration. This is a practical application and therefore a positive user experience was critical. Colours were chosen to make navigation of the application as easy as possible, with good contrast between sections, easy to see buttons with responsive elements so the user was clear when a button was clicked and selected or deselected. 

I identified a pastel shade of blue and then used w3 schools colour picker to select different colours of the same tone. (HTML Color Picker (w3schools.com)) This created a soft, cohesive feel to the colour scheme with a high level of harmony, which was important for a consistent user experience.

The colour palette is shown below: 

Coral: #e7b7b 
Mint: #7befb5
Lilac: #c491ef
Candy pink: #f070a1
Periwinkle blue: #799aef

### Typography
Ease of use was the primary consideration for the typography. For this reason, text was kept black and ……………………………..XXXXXXXXX font was used. 

### Imagery
It was important to keep the background simple, without being boring. So I chose to create a gradient in the website colour palette. This allowed me to add some interest to the background, in line with the cute/cartoon/retro feel of the theme, whilst maintaining a simple feel that would not distract from the application. I used Colorzilla for this: Ultimate CSS Gradient Generator - ColorZilla.com. 

This project took a lot of time to construct and test the back end. As a result, I had to prioritise functionality and testing in order to get the calculator working properly in the timeframe. If I had more time I would go back to the front end design and make it a little slicker and more modern by playing around with the colour placement.

The images used to represent the different colours of cat were a critical part of the design, and there is more detail on the decision making framework for this in the section above. The images were commissioned for me, and paid for with a full licence for commercial use so I am the owner of these images.
