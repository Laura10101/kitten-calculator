# British Shorthair Kitten Calculator

British shorthair cats are the most popular breed of cat in the UK. There is a large body of hobby breeders who enjoy raising kittens. However, feline genetics is a complicated area, and because the British Shorthair is available in a broad range of colours and patterns, it can be very difficult for breeders to predict what colour of kittens they will get from their cats. 

This kitten calculator is designed for hobby breeders, who have a basic knowledge of cat colours and feline genetics. It assumes, therefore, that its users will already know the basic terminology for feline colours: blue is grey, chocolate is brown, cinnamon is a warm brown, and so on. In order to make the application as accessible as possible, I have also opted to have images of each of the different variations of cats that is possible from the genes that have been used. This means that even where a user is not aware that blue means grey, there will be a visual representation of each colour and pattern. I used a recommended freelancer on Fiver to create these for the project, in the colours and patterns that I determined and provided photographs for. I am the owner of the copyright of these images since they were paid for with full commercial rights for use. 

The kitten calculator will be placed on an existing website. It will keep people returning to the site, thereby helping to increase web traffic. The website in question is a member of the Amazon Affiliate Marketing scheme, so an increase in web traffic may lead to an increase in site income through that scheme. It will also assist with establishing the website as a trusted source of expert information. 

## Users
Users will be British Shorthair breeders. Some will be new to breeding, or just considering breeding, and therefore not have any knowledge beyond the most basic terminology. Others will be more experienced, understand all the terminology and be able to calculate the colour of kittens themselves, but want a quicker or easier way of achieving it. 

This website presents an interesting exercise in user experience. For a very experienced breeder who understands feline genetics at a high level, there is a risk that images and explanations will simply crowd the page, reducing user experience. For a total novice who knows nothing about feline genetics, the more information the site provides, the better the user experience will be. 

The key in optimising user experience, therefore, is to try to gauge what level of genetic knowledge the majority of users will have, and aim to optimise user experience for that level of knowledge. Since this question was so vital to creating optimal user experience, I conducted a small survey of 20 breeders and found that only 5% had extensive knowledge of feline genetics. The vast majority understood basic terminology of coat colour (e.g. blue means grey), and understood the dominance of basic colours in practice, but did not fully understand the theory of recessive and dominant genes. 

A small number of breeders (10%), did not understand basic terminology or the hierarchy of colour dominance. 

I therefore chose to optimise user experience for those with a basic understanding of genetics in practice, whilst including images for the total novices, since this should provide optimal customer experience for the greatest number of users. This approach should allow the primary objective of increasing web traffic to be met. 

It may be that this site is not well suited to experienced breeders with expert knowledge of feline genetics. In future, I may create a second, ‘advanced’ version of this calculator that is aimed at experts and has a far more simple, ‘to the point’ user experience that simply allows a quick calculation to be performed without the fuss of explanations and images.
